This type of writing gains a high position in the digital world. Content writers  can earn a huge amount of cash by producing plagiarism-free well-structured contents. Oxford Reference defines plagiarism as a deceitful task to utilize others’ possession as one’s own. Content with plagiarism is thus acknowledged as an unwelcome activity. When any content writer blindly copies information from other writing and utilizes it in own work then that is criticized as plagiarism.  Plagiarism is totally unacceptable in any context of content writing.  A proper content should always be free from any type of plagiarism. A content reflects the thoughts and ideas of its creator. A plagiarism-free content describes the individuality of its writer.",
